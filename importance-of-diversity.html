			<h3>Airbags and Stairs</h3>
			<p>When airbags were invented, they were considered as safety inventions that were potentially life-saving....unless you were a women or child. The all male team that produced the airbag calibrated for their body builds failing to account for women and children passengers. The results were higher mortality rates for women and children. Even to this day, mostly male test dummies are used for tests and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/female-dummy-makes-her-mark-on-male-dominated-crash-tests/2012/03/07/gIQANBLjaS_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.efce20b9bb71">women are more likely to suffer serious injuries in car crashes.</a></p>

In 2018 Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">"fixed" this issue</a> by removing the gorilla label.</p>
